## Components
The <bASF.Components</b> describes the components that form the
tree view.  Each component has attributes and children.  Children
represent sub-components and attributes control the rendering and
behavior of the component.

The component tree is created from the <b>ASF.Views</b> tag nodes
for each request.  Unlike tag nodes, the component tree is not shared.
