## ui:include

Use this tagâ€”which is very similar to JSP's jsp:include to encapsulate and reuse
content among multiple XHTML pages. There are three things this tag can include:
plain XHTML, and XHTML pages that have either a composition tag or a component tag.

You supply a filename, through `ui:include`'s src attribute for JSF to include.
That filename is relative to the XHTML file that was rendered as a result of the
last request. So, for example, if JSF loaded the view `login.xhtml`, and that file
included `pageDecorations/header.xhtml`, and `pageDecorations/header.xhtml` included
`companyLogo.xhtml`, then `companyLogo.xhtml` will not be found if it's in the
`pageDecorations` directory, because `companyLogo.xhtml` has to be in the same
directory as `login.xhtml`.


### Attributes

| Name  | Required | Type            | Description                                        |
| ----- | -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| src   | true     | String          | The filename of an XHTML page to include. The filename is relative to the XHTML page that was originally loaded. |


### Example

```XML
<div xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
    <ui:include src="composition.xhtml">
        <ui:param name="name" value="include"/>
    </ui:include>
    <ui:include src="../jstl/if.xhtml"/>
</div>
```
