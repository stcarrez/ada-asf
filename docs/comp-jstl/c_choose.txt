## c:choose

This tag associates a parameter name-value pair with the nearest parent UIComponent.
A UIComponent is created to represent this name-value pair, and stored as a child
of the parent component; what effect this has depends upon the renderer of that
parent component.

Unless otherwise specified, all attributes accept static values or EL expressions.

### Attributes

  </c:when>
</c:choose>
